Formatter Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Write it like a general formatter, a la RSpec:

Formatter Methods:

  - init(num_concurrent):
    Splits console horizontally. Bottom half contains log messages.
    Top half contains a "horse race" of dots, each line is 1 Runner in
    its own thread.

  - example_passed(runner)
    Adds a green dot on the line for that runner

  - example_failed(runner)
    Adds a red F on the line for that runner

  - example_pending(runner)
    Adds a yellow P on the line for that runner

  - example_errored(runner)
    Adds a purple E on the line for that runner

  - log(msg)
    Writes msg to the log window


Other crap:

- msg window should scroll when filled

-
