CHANGES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-01-09:

- tourbus -l will now check see if a file in tours actually defines a
  constant by that name that inherits from Tour, as opposed to barfing
  spectacularly on files in the tour_helpers folder.

- Added a config file option. Tourbus looks for tourbus.yml in .,
  ./tours, ./config, and ~. Any options set there will be merged into
  the command-line args. (Command-line args override config file
  options, naturally.)

  Added tourbus.sample.yml to show what fields are available.
