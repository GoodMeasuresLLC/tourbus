VERSION 2.0.0 WOOOOOOO!

- Version 2.0.0

!!!! WARNING: THIS CHANGE BREAKS TourBus 1.x TOURS !!!!


tl;dr: Tours are now called Tourists, and tests are now called tours.
Open all your tour classes and make two changes: 

  1. Rename "< Tour" to "< Tourist". I picked the wrong name for your
     base classes. It's fixed now. Sorry about that.

  2. Rename all your "test_" methods to "tour_" methods. These are the
     individual tours.

  3. Rename any before_tests and after_tests methods to before_tours
     and after_tours.

  4. SERIOUSLY tl;dr? Okay fine:

     cd $your_project/tours
     perl -ipe "s/< Tour\s*$/< Tourist/" *.rb
     perl -ipe "s/(before|after)_tests\s*$/$1_tours/" *.rb
     perl -ipe "s/^(\s*)def test_/$1def tour_/" *.rb

Everything else should just work. CAVEAT HACKOR: I wrote those perl
scripts from memory and haven't even attempted them, let alone tested.
Make backups and YMMV.

  - Tours are now called Tourists. THIS AFFECTS YOUR EXISTING TOURS.
    You need to rename your "< Tour" classes to inherit from "<
    Tourist". Sorry about that, but the name was wrong. Reason for
    this change is that the thing I was calling a Tour was being
    collected into a tour group and then walked around on many tours.
    This is the definition of a tourist.
  - test_ methods are called tours, so you should begin them with
    tour_.
  - TourBus is the master class that launches Runners.
  - Runners are basically the "Tour Guides" that lead a bunch of
    Tourists through the website. I may rename these to "TourGuide" at
    some point if the naming scheme is communicative. When I first
    wrote it it felt cutesy but in summarizing here it kind of makes
    sense. I'm okay releasing the 2.0 version now and making this
    change later because changing Runner to TourGuide will not break
    TourBus clients.

2009-04-30:
-----------

- Version 0.0.9:

  - before_tour, after_tour added by JTZemp. Runs at the beginning and
    end of each tour.


2009-04-17:
-----------

- Version 0.0.8:

  - Per-test filtering added by James Britt.

    Dave notes: Beware, there's a gotcha. TourBus will accept multiple
    tours to run (e.g. "tourbus simple login contact"), and if you
    specify filtering, you'll get the intersection of tests and tours.
    There's no way to select 'this test from this tour, and that test
    from that tour'. I think it's a great feature though because when
    you want to zero in on a specific test you're usually focused in
    on a specific tour, too.

2009-01-10:
-----------

- Added README.rdoc to examples/contact_app

- Added first example! Brain-dead Sinatra app that can be toured.

- Added test name to logging output in tour.

- Added missing tourbus.yml file to gemspec.

- Removed a bit of debugging code that printed options and then
  exited. This made actually running the app rather difficult. Heh.
  Oops.


2009-01-09:
-----------

- tourbus -l will now check see if a file in tours actually defines a
  constant by that name that inherits from Tour, as opposed to barfing
  spectacularly on files in the tour_helpers folder.

- Added a config file option. Tourbus looks for tourbus.yml in .,
  ./tours, ./config, and ~. Any options set there will be merged into
  the command-line args. (Command-line args override config file
  options, naturally.)

  Added tourbus.sample.yml to show what fields are available.
