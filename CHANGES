CHANGES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-01-10:
-----------

- Added README.rdoc to examples/contact_app

- Added first example! Brain-dead Sinatra app that can be toured.

- Added test name to logging output in tour.

- Added missing tourbus.yml file to gemspec.

- Removed a bit of debugging code that printed options and then
  exited. This made actually running the app rather difficult. Heh.
  Oops.


2009-01-09:
-----------

- tourbus -l will now check see if a file in tours actually defines a
  constant by that name that inherits from Tour, as opposed to barfing
  spectacularly on files in the tour_helpers folder.

- Added a config file option. Tourbus looks for tourbus.yml in .,
  ./tours, ./config, and ~. Any options set there will be merged into
  the command-line args. (Command-line args override config file
  options, naturally.)

  Added tourbus.sample.yml to show what fields are available.
