----------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:
----------

x Runner crashes if a test breaks. That's a bit... fragile.

x Weird crash: tour_helper.rb is getting picked up and run as a tour,
  which crashes. Make this not happen.

TODO:
----------

- Add the NCurses front end. Look at all the pretty little dots...

x Tourbus should log start/end of each tour. Currently we see the
  Runner logging endpoints but not the tours or tests.

- Tourbus should log start/end of each test.

- Tourbus should log start/end of each mechanize call to enable deep
  timing data (e.g. to let us see that index page loads fast but page2
  is very slow).

- Add deep timing data. This will involve wrappering all the calls so
  that each step of each tour can be aggregated. Let's do this
  top-down, and I'll start off by adding the hooks at the top level,
  then drill down and implement them later.

  I think three log calls:

  - log_start(id, msg) - Creates a log event with start = now
  - log_finish(id) - Updates log event with end = now
  - log_event - Creates a log event with start = end = now

- Enhance Reporting to include stats notes from Amy
  - Show min, max, mean, stddev, count, count > +2S, count < -2S

- Replace WebSickle with WebRat. This will primarily involve
  wrappering the submit form calls to take deeply nested hashes.

- Make RSpec expectations be worky

- Look at comingling Cucumber features with TourBus tours

- Review the rest of this TODO, update it, and check it in so the work
  list is ready for the hackfest.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
x EXAMPLES! Set up a sinatra or camping app, then test it with
  TourBus.

- SPECS!!! Set up examples first, then figure out how to use the
  example servers as part of the test/spec framework. Also, features!

- Add a -c 0 option that will run one concurrent tour in the main
  thread. This would flatten the thread model for debugging crashes.

- Add a travelogue. Reporting needs to show average times and speeds
  for each tour and each test inside the tours. Ideally, all actions
  dispatched to WebSickle should also be timed, so the final report
  can show average times for each step of each test of each tour.

- Have all threads "report in" before giving out any jobs. Thread
  spin-up is expensive in JRuby so Runner #1 is often 10-20 seconds
  down the road before Runner #10 gets off the block. If all Runners
  had to report to the starting line.

- Add a unit-test style mode, where instead of a big scrolling log you
  get a row of ./F/E. At the end, if there were failures it should
  display a report of their stack traces.

- Add an NCurses mode that would do the ./F/E thing, placing each
  thread on a separate row in a top panel, with a log panel:

- Add a convoy mode, where concurrency can be varied and the results
  graphed after the run. So you fire it off and let it pound your
  server for minutes or an hour, and it reports, e.g. the average
  speed per tour at each concurrency of 1, 10, 50, and 100.
