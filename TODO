Tourbus 2.0 Todo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Change naming. Several people have asked me 
- Change test_ to tour_.

  Ahh, I remember now why I never did this. The *class* is called
  Tour. Calling a test *method* tour_ as well led me quickly to
  confusion. To rename test_ to tour_, I'd really want to rename the
  Tour class to something like Tourist.

- Look at RSpec style declarations? describe, before(:each) do etc?

- before(:all), before(:suite)

- tour_proxy - capture sessions, including AMF

- AMF support

- Explore having tour_proxy emit tour files outright?

- Look at JMeter's samplers and reporters. Can probably 80/20 that.

- Proper specs!

- Rails plugin, add a generators and rake tour tasks. E.g. rake
  ddos:tour etc.

- Make sure this plays well with Rails 3.0 and Ruby 1.9

- Make sure this plays well with latest JRuby

- Add a long-burning mode, perhaps time-based. Helps find things like
  databases that slowly begin swapping and then finally fall over.
  Could do this with e.g. -n 10000 but a better idea might be to say
  "run for the next 20 minutes", or "run until I hit Ctrl-C".

  Because really, who wants to sit around babysitting their DDoS tool?
