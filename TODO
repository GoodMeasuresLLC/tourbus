Tourbus 2.0 Todo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Change naming. Several people have asked me 
- Change test_ to tour_.

  Ahh, I remember now why I never did this. The *class* is called
  Tour. Calling a test *method* tour_ as well led me quickly to
  confusion. To rename test_ to tour_, I'd really want to rename the
  Tour class to something like Tourist.

- Look at RSpec style declarations? describe, before(:each) do etc?

- before(:all), before(:suite)

- tour_proxy - capture sessions, including AMF

- AMF support

- Explore having tour_proxy emit tour files outright?

- Look at JMeter's samplers and reporters. Can probably 80/20 that.

- Proper specs!

- Rails plugin, add a generators and rake tour tasks. E.g. rake
  ddos:tour etc.

- Make sure this plays well with Rails 3.0 and Ruby 1.9

- Make sure this plays well with latest JRuby
