TODO

- EXAMPLES! Set up a sinatra or camping app, then test it with
  TourBus.

- SPECS!!! Set up examples first, then figure out how to use the
  example servers as part of the test/spec framework.

- Add a -c 0 option that will run one concurrent tour in the main
  thread. This would flatten the thread model for debugging crashes.

- Add a travelogue. Reporting needs to show average times and speeds
  for each tour and each test inside the tours. Ideally, all actions
  dispatched to WebSickle should also be timed, so the final report
  can show average times for each step of each test of each tour.

- Have all threads "report in" before giving out any jobs. Thread
  spin-up is expensive in JRuby so Runner #1 is often 10-20 seconds
  down the road before Runner #10 gets off the block. If all Runners
  had to report to the starting line.
